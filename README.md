1.For this project, I am working with Chada Tech and they want a program created so that users can view a 12-hour clock and a 24 hour clock instead of just the 12 hour clock. The clocks should be able to be manipulated and also be able to display the correct time simultaneously.
2.With this project I felt that I did very well. My code was correct and the program executed the ouput as it should. 
3.Overall, I believe I did very well with my code. I think once thing I could have done was maybe change the if statements to switch statements. Switch statements tend to be easier to read and the makes compilation faster because it overcomes any bugs caused from if else statements.
4.I did encounter some challenges while writing the code. Mostly it was orginazational issues. I wanted my code to easy to read and wanted it to flow well. I was afraid I would drift far from the main job of the project, so I did stop and go back to course material as well as outside tutorials simply for help with orginization and things to think about when writing code and how to write clean code.
5.With this project gave me a different understanding of functions. Functions are the central part of writing code and programming in general and I believe that the knowledge I have gained with functions will be easily transfered into other projects and assignments.
6.In order for me to keep this project maintainable, readable and adaptable, I simply followed the steps that I've learned in this course as well as other courses and online tutorials. I also made sure to keep my code well orginized, clean and professional.
